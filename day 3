File descriptions and redirections
File descriptors are needed to track every file on the system, and it points to the file table and the file table points to the inodes.

Redirection is redirecting a code inside a file and not to display on the screen. Eg, echo hello >somefile
cat somefile, this displays hello.
Let's say we want to add another sentence into the somefile amd we dont want the previous file deleted we use 
echo I am learning devops >>somefile

File descriptors are
 standard input and these are data that you input into the system from your keyboard it is represented by 0 stdin

standard out which is the number 1, is the data stream that prints onto the screen stdout

standard error which is the number 2 stderr
they are represented by numbers

Find command find / -name daniel.io
find / -name daniel.io > stdout.txt
less stdout.txt

find / -name daniel.io 2> errors.txt
What we did here is a redirection which is we are using the standard error 2 to redirect errors 
into stdout.txt so we don't output it on the screen.

vim error.txt &
We are about to read the process of the vim

ps which means process status ps -ef | grep 4677
I passed the process of 4677 using a | grep to filter out unwanted information

Then to check the libraries the process vim is using we use the command lsof
lsof | grep 4677(the process code)

User groups and permissions
sudo means super user do
su command is used to switch user Eg, sudo su
su peter
exit to exit the user and another exit

to add a user to a group we use the command groupadd, Eg,
sudo groupadd jundev - This is to create the group
sudo grep jundev /etc/group - This is to check the group
sudo usermod -a -G jundev peter - This is to add the user and modify it to the group (The capital G flag is appending a user to a group)
userdel is to delete user

-rwxrwxrwx - This represents a file, this is also the permissions
drwxrwxr - This represents a directory

Create a file touch permissions_demo
See the whole folder ls -l

chmod - Change mode
chmod u+x or w or r permissions_demo - This is to add permissions for users
chmod u-x or w or r permissions_demo - This is to remove permissions for users
chmod g+x or w or r permissions_demo - This is to add permissions for group
chmod o+x or w or r permissions_demo - This is to add permissions for others

permissions can be of
read -4
write 2
execute -1
no permission -0

Permissions can be a combination of 
Read + write + Execute - 7
Read + Write - 6
Read + Execute - 5
Write + Execute - 3

So instead of writing permissions 1 by 1 you can combine them.
chmod
